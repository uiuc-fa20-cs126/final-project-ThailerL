# Project Proposal
## The Project
I want to create a timed 2D platforming game with multiple levels. In the game, you
would control a character that can shoot a projectile by pointing the mouse and then teleport to the
projectile's location on demand, consuming the projectile. There will be multiple
levels in a main menu that can be selected, with the high score shown next to the
level. The high score being the least amount of time the player has ever completed
that level. There will be platforms that the player can jump to and a goal to reach.
## Motivation
In the past I have tinkered around with the Unity game engine because I used to want
to create video games. In Unity I made a minimum working version of this game in 3D many
years ago, but that handled a lot of the complexity for me, such as the object interactions,
terrain, and graphics. Now with Cinder, I would have to figure out how to handle all of that.
I think I will be motivated to complete this project because I already have an idea of how the game works
and it was something I had fun doing when I created the 3D version.
## Timeline
### Week 1
Create a basic level with a movable character.
### Week 2
Implement shooting projectile to teleport and finishing a level.
### Week 3
Implement timing, the main menu, and multiple levels.

## Stretch goals
- Implement being able to shoot 2 different colored projectiles, for example
left click for red and right click for green. Then, click left click again to teleport
to the red projectile and right click to teleport to green. This would add a lot more skill
expression and complexity if the levels allow are made for it.
- Implement progression by not letting the player play later levels until they have completed
the levels before it under a certain time.
